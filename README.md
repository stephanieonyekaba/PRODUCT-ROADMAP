<h2>PRODUCT VISION</h2>
<p>The vision of TrialTracker is to create an all-in-one pharmaceutical trial management platform that seamlessly integrates all aspects of the clinical trial process, ensuring the highest level of efficacy and safety for patients.</p>

<h2>PRODUCT ROADMAP (3-6 month plan)</h2>

<h3>MONTH 1</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Define key features and personas</p>
<p><strong>Persona:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Description:</strong> John Doe is a researcher working for one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the US looking to conduct clinical research for a stem cell treatment therapy. He is looking for a platform that will seamlessly integrate with third-party systems and make the process of collecting and analyzing data simple.</li>
  <li><strong>Demographics:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Age: 34</li>
      <li>Gender: Male</li>
      <li>Education: PhD from University of Chicago</li>
      <li>Specialty: Stem cell research</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pain Points:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Calling hospital systems to retrieve patient preclinical data such as labs (often left on hold for hours)</li>
      <li>Manually giving out waivers/consent forms (is tedious to enter into digital system and waste paper)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Goals/Motivations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Find a way to organize his data all in one place</li>
      <li>Easily compare treatment results with placebo</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Patient EHR: This feature pulls in EHR data from hospitals, allowing researchers to see the patient's current/past medical history as well as preclinical trial labs work.</li>
  <li>Clinical Trial Phase Tracker: This feature allows researchers to enter their findings throughout the course of the clinical trial for the patient as well as compare treated patients to placebo patients.</li>
  <li>Electronic HIPAA regulation/clinical trial consent form: Feature will allow users to view their rights for data privacy and consent to participation in clinical trials.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Conduct market research on current pharmaceutical trial platforms on the market. Who are our direct/indirect competitors? What are key features of their platform?</li>
  <li>Conduct user research via exploratory interviews with end users. What are their key pain points?</li>
</ul>

<h3>MONTH 2</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create an MVP utilizing lean principles</p>
<p><strong>MVP:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Utilize Firebase as the backend cloud service for managing databases.
    <ul>
      <li>PRO: FireBase is free/low cost. Easy to sign up.</li>
      <li>CON: Must create an account using email which may not be as secure as utilizing more expensive web services such as AWS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Utilize React as front end
    <ul>
      <li>PRO: Dynamic libraries/component-based architecture.</li>
      <li>CON: Large libraries. Not as popular as other frameworks such as Angular.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Create backend infrastructure for data management.</li>
  <li>Create a front end UI.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MONTH 3</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Deploy platform and conduct user testing</p>
<p><strong>Platform deployment:</strong> Deploy platform using FireBase web services.</p>
<p><strong>Conduct User Testing:</strong> Have users explore each of the three features. Assess their ability in navigating the platform as well as the extent to which they are utilizing each feature.</p>
<p><strong>Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Conduct QA/unit tests for the app, then deploy on web app hosting service.</li>
  <li>Conduct beta trial sessions for users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MONTH 4 AND BEYOND</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Continue to iterate on beta version, prioritizing key features and user pain points</p>
<p><strong>Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Utilize A/B testing to define key metrics.</li>
  <li>Utilize user surveys/feedback to improve with each iteration.</li>
  <li>Monitor market trends to identify product opportunities/weaknesses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Considerations/Bottlenecks</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Steady growth in clinical trial search within the past 12 months, with the US holding top 5 most searches in the world. A steady increase of searches for clinical trials can suggest there is a market for integrated clinical trial management platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Lack of credibility in a highly variable/regulated industry. As clinical trials are not FDA approved, fundraising may serve as a bottleneck for raising capital.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Novelty in a market with few direct competitors. As there are only very few clinical trial management platforms on the market, creating features that address specific user pain points could set the platform apart from others.</p>
<p><strong>Threats:</strong> Competitors capturing large shares of the market. As clinical trial research is a highly regulated and variable industry, large players in the management platform space may capture large shares of markets through prearranged contracts with pharmaceutical companies.</p>
